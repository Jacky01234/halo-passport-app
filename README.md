Provide a platform for recieving the notification of test result
Utlizing the block chain and IPMS to prevent falsify of vaccination record and test result 


//Inspiration

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people are required to acquire a negative COVID-19 test result before travelling aboard in order to decline the spreading of the disease. As the test result takes time and expeniture, some people are trying to falsify the result. Varies false certificates and fake documents were sold within the airport and onine platform, like telegram. 

When we trying to solve this problem, a similar case about falsify of document pop up in our discussion. It is about Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) making a digital certificate for graduate student by the technology of blockchain. Whereas blockchain is a technology which stores digital asset in a decentralized way, in the other word, the data is stored in an commonly owned open space which is less easy to be maliciously modified.

Therefore, we think of using the blockchain associated with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to make a immunity passport. And we proudly named it as Halo passport.
